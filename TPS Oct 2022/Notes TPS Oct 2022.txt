TPS - Oct 2022

- predict the probability of each team scoring within the next 10 seconds of the game given a snapshot from a Rocket League match
- dealing with big data
- evaluation: log loss (the smaller the better)

V1

Scaling down the dataset:
- removing features:
	- game_num, event_id, event_time
	- boost_timer, team_scoring_next, player_scoring_next

- removing rows: 
	- check out the time series in the training 
		- data point every 0.1 seconds (10 frames per second) -> keep only one point in X (20) rows
	- check out the rows with missing entries in training


- wrangling:
	- get coordinates of the goal posts [0, -104, 1.3] and [0, 104, 1.3]
	- fill NaN values with coordinates of the goal post
	- get difference between goal posts and ball
	- get difference between ball and each player

- LightGBM

V2 - Clean code & try CatBoost

V3 - Try different model hyperparameters

V4 - Train on more data (train_0, train_1, train_2)

V5 - Try different snapshot intervals (40)

V6 - Train on all data

V7 - LGBM Classifier

V8 - Hyperparameters tuning
