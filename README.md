# Ended Kaggle Competitions

## 1) Tabular Playground Series - Oct 2022
- Period: October 1, 2022 - October 31, 2022
- Objective: predict the probability of each team scoring within the next 10 seconds of the game given a snapshot from a Rocket League match
- Data: sequences of snapshots of the state of a Rocket League match, including position and velocity of all players and the ball, as well as extra information
- Task: 2-target Regression
- Evaluation Metric: Mean log loss of the target variables
- Algorithms: LightGBM Regressor, LightGBM Classifier (predict_proba), CatBoost Regressor
- Result: 0.20210 (253/463 - Top 55%)
- Key insights: removing most of the snapshots (95%) saves space, improves fitting time, and does not have negative implications over the result; ball velocity and its distance from the y=0 axis are the most important features in predicting the probability of a team to score within the next 10 seconds
